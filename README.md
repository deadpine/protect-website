## Built on

This was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and:

- [`@next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimise delivery of font files.

- a [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) pre-commit hook to lint (eslint) and check unused imports (eslint-plugin-unused-imports)

- [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) to apply formatting using standard class names
